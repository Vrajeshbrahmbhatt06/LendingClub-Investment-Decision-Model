# Lending Club Loan Prediction Model

## Overview
For this project, we will be exploring publicly available data from [LendingClub.com](www.lendingclub.com). Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor, you would want to invest in people who show a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this.

Lending Club had a [very interesting year in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lending_Club#2016), so let's check out some of their data and keep the context in mind. This data is from before they even went public.

## Data Source
We will use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. You can download the data from [here](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) or just use the CSV file already provided.

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict whether a borrower will pay back their loan in full, based on the available data. To accomplish this, we will first explore the data to gain insights and understanding. Then, we will preprocess the data, perform feature engineering and selection, and build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms. Finally, we will evaluate the performance of the model and make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Files Included
- `investment_decision_model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and selection, and machine learning model building.
- `loan_data.csv`: CSV file containing the lending data from 2007-2010.

## Conclusion
By building a model that can accurately predict whether a borrower will pay back their loan in full, investors can make better investment decisions and reduce their risk of losses. This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in making predictions from data, and provides a practical example of how to approach a classification problem using Python and popular machine learning libraries.
